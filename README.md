# Classification-of-histopatological-images
Bachelor degree work.  Matlab project for the classification of histopathological images, created using features extracted from neural networks trained for image recognition.


Welcome in my Bachelor degree work!

In this thesis work we studied the development of support systems for the diagnosis of breast cancer, based on the application of Machine Learning techniques to microscopic images of mammary tissues, obtained by immunohistochemical histological examinations. In particular, the work was based on the discrimination between pathological subjects (i.e., with malignant tumor masses) and healthy (i.e., with benign tumor masses).
The histological images under examination were placed in input of a convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained for object recognition (AlexNet), used here to extract the most relevant features for classification. This pre-processing phase was aimed at providing a classifier with the elements processed and manipulated with an instrument already trained in the classification of images, and therefore capable of extracting the salient elements that characterize it; in order to facilitate the task of distinguish between malignant and benign tumors, in general the features extracted from neural network levels are difficult to interpret.
In the second analysis, some dimensionality reduction techniques were applied that allowed to obtain vectors with reduced and non-redundant characteristics.
Finally two classifiers have been trained, with two different algorithms, able to discriminate between malign and benign subjects and their performances have been evaluated.
in summary the work steps were:
- Extraction of features from a neural network
- Use of techniques to reduce dimensionality
- Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms for image classification
- Analysis of the results at different levels of features, quality of rudimentary dimensionality techniques and classification algorithms
